<h1>Read Me - SCS320-4</h1>

<p>Hey, if you're reading this document you're either the next group who's been selected to continue this project, or you're someone from Xceed Electrical who's attempting to upgrade the project.</p>

<p>The project you're looking at makes use of the Laravel 7 framework, which was used to build the back-end functions and Bootstrap 4, which was used to build the front-end webpage. We've used the Model-View-Controller standard to develop the project.</p>

<p>As a quick summary, the Models determine the website's use of the database (e.g. which tables are needed, the attributes used, and the relationships needed.), the Views are used to generate the HTML which builds the front-end of the page, and the Controllers are where much of the functions and logic that make the site work are defined.</p>

<p>You'll find a much better explaination of what we've said here, and more, in the official Laravel documentation: https://laravel.com/docs/7.x</p>
<p>We'd also recommend the Laracasts podcast, which will be of much aid with understanding Laravel's functions: https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch</p>

<p>Other than Laravel, you'll need to install the following:</p>
<p>- XAMPP</p>
<p>- DomPDF (https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf)</p>

<p>While we'd personally call this project complete, there are a few hitches in our code which we weren't able to resolve before we completed the project:</p>
<p>- Values go negative when choosing a quantity in the system.</p>
<p>- Remove button completely removes all the job structure.</p>
<p>- DOM pdf CSS compatibility.</p>
<p>- Reset password with email only works using testing server of mailtrap.</p>

<p>As for how we'd go about improving the project:</p>
<p>- Minor detailing in the formulae and functions.</p>
<p>- Extra functions can be added to the system according to the clientâ€™s requirements.</p>
<p>- Further improvement with the known bugs.</p>

<p>We're hoping that you'll be able to springboard off of our work and be able to complete your objectives smoothly.</p>

<p>Wishing you the best,</p>
<p>Johnny, Abhinav, Zihao, Daniel and Ahmer</p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
